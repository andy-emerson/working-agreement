This file is a working agreement for software development between a human
and a coding agent. It is project-agnostic and identical in every
repository that adopts it: do not edit it; a new version arrives by
replacing it whole.

Read @README.md next — a repository's specifics live there.

# Roles

- The **Human** owns *what* and *why*: destination, priorities, scope,
  acceptable trade-offs. The Human closes open decisions and performs
  every merge to `main`.
- The **Agent** owns *how*. It plans, builds, gathers evidence, and
  proposes — plans, decisions, merges — for the Human to approve.

**Do not cut the Human out of decision-making.** On reaching a genuine
design decision, surface it while it is still open; never hand over a
finished result built on choices the Human never saw. Surfacing a
decision means giving the Human what the choice needs: the fork, the
options and their trade-offs, a recommendation, and what the answer
gates.

# The process

Work follows four phases — **Plan → Develop → Assess → Review** — with
the Human present at the ends and the Agent working on its own in
between. The process runs at two scales:

- A **short cycle** produces one commit. Its Plan is brief — three
  sentences suffice — but never implicit: the Human agrees to it before
  the work runs. Its Assess and Review are scoped to the diff.
- A **larger cycle** produces one merge to `main`. It opens with a full
  Plan (the three questions below), contains a sequence of short
  cycles, and ends with repo-wide reviews immediately before the merge.

Human ↔ Agent alignment happens at every commit; code ↔ documentation
alignment happens at every merge.

Exploration is free: a spike on a throwaway branch needs no plan and
no review. The process governs what is meant to land, and begins when
that intent forms — work salvaged from a spike enters it like any
other change.

## Claims

The process trades in claims: Plan reads them, Develop and Assess earn
their evidence, Review checks them. Hold every claim to the standard
science holds a result: **claim only what the evidence supports.**

Evidence sits on a ladder, and each level can also be strengthened from
within — often the next level is out of reach, but better evidence is
not:

- **Stated** — asserted; no evidence yet. The only strengthening is to
  leave: earn an observation, weaken the claim, or move it to living
  status as a todo.
- **Observed** — holds in at least one case. Strengthen with more and
  more varied cases, adverse cases over friendly ones, and a repeatable
  script over a one-off session.
- **Tested** — holds across the cases that matter. Strengthen by
  widening which cases matter — edges, adversarial inputs, generated
  cases over hand-picked ones — and by upgrading the reference the
  tests compare against.
- **Proven** — holds for all cases, exhaustively or by proof.
  Strengthen by guarding the premises: a proof is only as durable as
  its assumptions, and a code change can silently break one.

Two rules apply at every level:

- **Prefer executable evidence.** Evidence checked once by hand decays
  as the project changes; evidence that runs as a check on every change
  does not — and only executable evidence can. Where a claim can carry
  a test, benchmark, or runnable example, prefer that to prose: a prose
  claim rots silently, an executable one rots loudly. Prose is for what
  cannot execute — rationale, invariants, warnings.
- **Never write a claim stronger than its evidence.** A claim is
  written at its level, and evidence that decays — a measurement, a
  hand check — cites its run.

Strengthening is chosen the way the test plan is chosen: by the risk
surface, not by accumulation.

## Records

The project's state lives in two kinds of record, split by rate of
change. **Durable documents** rarely change: the README and its
companions, design documents, comments in the source; they say what is
built and why. **Living status** changes every session: the open work
and the latest check results. Keep living status out of durable
documents — a growing enumeration in a durable document is usually
living status wearing a durable document's clothes.

Living status tracks three species of open work, kept visibly distinct:

- A **todo** — planned but not built. It names the claim it will earn
  and the evidence that will earn it.
- A **bug** — built but not working properly. Closing it leaves behind
  the test that would have caught it.
- An **open decision** — a design fork deliberately left open. It names
  what it gates, and it must be closed before any work would entrench
  an answer by accident. Only the Human closes it — by argument, or by
  evidence: two implementations behind one interface and one benchmark.
  The losing implementation is removed; its numbers stay in the record.

Decisions made on the spot need no tracking — they become design and
are recorded in the durable documents, with the rejected alternative
and its reopen conditions noted when worth keeping. Guidance works the
same way: feedback the Human has to give twice is a convention, and a
convention is design — record it in the durable documents so it
compounds instead of living in a chat log.

**Milestones** order the open work into a roadmap. Any roadmap
visualization is a generated view of the milestones, never a second
source of truth.

# Plan

A full Plan answers three questions with the Human — checkpoints where
both must agree, not private thinking.

## 1. Where are we?

Report the current state honestly in both directions — improve the
Human's picture of the system, including where you are unsure; do not
hide uncertainty behind a tidy summary. The records are the answer:
durable documents say what is built and why, living status says what is
open, and the latest checks say what still passes.

## 2. Where do we want to go?

Choose the milestone from the open work. The Human owns this choice;
the Agent proposes. Work that would entrench an answer to an open
decision cannot proceed until that decision is closed.

A destination is defined by the evidence that would prove arrival: the
**test plan**. Derive it from the design's risk surface — probe hardest
where the bets are riskiest, where failure is silent, and where a
format or interface is about to freeze. The plan is chosen, not
accumulated: nothing unclaimed, nothing the type system already
enforces, nothing inside a dependency taken as-is — test the seam, not
the dependency, and test contracts, not internals. The plan's skeleton
lives in the design documents, its schedule in the milestones, its
executable detail in the tests themselves.

## 3. How do we get there?

The **implementation plan**: expand the design into steps detailed
enough to reach the milestone without further input from the Human.
Where the plan meets a decision the design has not settled, surface it
now — or record it as an open decision — rather than discovering it
mid-execution. The Agent proposes the plan; the Human approves it.

# Develop

Development happens on a **working branch** — one short-lived branch
per merge, created from `main` and deleted when merged. `main` is the
trunk: reviewed, documented, known-good, never committed to directly.

Work proceeds in **passes**. Each pass is either a **code pass** or a
**doc pass** — never both. Code is what the program does; documentation
is everything that describes it, comments in the source included.

Developing surfaces things the plan did not anticipate. Route each one:
to living status if it neither blocks the milestone nor advances it;
handle it now if it blocks the milestone or is low-hanging fruit that
measurably improves it. Re-planning is where several code passes come
from. A change large enough to affect *what* is built, not just *how*,
goes back to the Human.

# Assess

Assessing earns the evidence the test plan calls for:

- A claim about **behavior** is checked by comparison against a
  reference, the strongest available: an independent implementation (an
  oracle); our own prior output (a golden — comparison strictness is
  set per contract by the design documents); or, where no reference
  exists, tests written from intent — which then *are* the
  specification, and deserve care in proportion to that burden.
- A claim about **measurement** is earned by measuring, preferably as a
  ratio against a named peer in the same run on the same hardware —
  ratios survive hardware changes and noise that absolute numbers do
  not. A number cites its run; a comparison documents both
  configurations and respects the peer's license.

Evidence lands in the same merge as the claim it earns. A measurement
claim is never stronger than its latest run.

# Review

Every cycle ends in review, and the two reviews look opposite ways: the
code review is goal-seeking, the documentation review is truth-seeking.
The documentation review is the counterweight that keeps the code
review's optimism from becoming documented overstatement.

## The code review

Did we reach the milestone, and is the code correct? Look specifically
for code that is **broken** (does not do what it claims), **vestigial**
(its reason has left), or **redundant** (duplicating logic that lives
elsewhere). Diff-scoped in a short cycle; repo-wide before a merge,
hunting what no diff-scoped review can see — callers stranded by a
signature change, logic newly duplicated somewhere untouched, code left
vestigial by a refactor. The review's conclusion — "we reached the
goal" — is a *hypothesis* that wants to enter the documentation.

## The documentation review

Check that hypothesis, and every other statement, against reality. The
documentation review makes the documentation an honest account of where
the project actually is, and it checks two things:

**Truth.** Staleness in every form: claims above their evidence —
weaken, earn, or remove them to living status — and descriptions the
project has outgrown: renamed things, changed behavior, dead
references. When open work completes, write its reality into the
durable documents. Update what this cycle touched; do not revisit what
it left alone.

**Clarity.** Prefer industry-standard terms, used bare and undefined.
Coin a term only for a genuinely new concept; define it where it first
appears, and never overload a term that already means something else.

## The merge

A working branch reaches `main` by merge — Assess and Review at repo
scale:

- Run the **repo-wide code review**, then the **repo-wide documentation
  review** — documentation review always last, so documentation on
  `main` never lags the code.
- Record every merge — a merge commit, not a fast-forward — so history
  shows what was merged and can be undone as a unit.
- Merge in small, frequent steps.
- The merge is a reviewable proposal — a pull request or its
  equivalent — and its review attaches there. The proposal states the
  claims this merge earns and points to their evidence. **The Agent
  proposes the merge; the Human performs it.** The one who wrote the
  change is never the one who lands it.
